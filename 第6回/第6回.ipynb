    "　対象データを2クラスに識別する手法である．一方のクラスのサポートベクターから境界への距離(マージン)と，もう一方のクラスのサポートベクターから境界への距離(マージン)が最大になる境界を採用してクラスを識別する．誤りなく識別できる場合はハードマージン法を，できない場合はソフトマージン法を利用する．\n",
    "##### ・決定木（DT）\n",
    "　ある説明変数についての閾値を決定し，分岐をたくさん用意することによって，分類する手法である．学習後のモデルが比較的ブラックボックスになりにくいことがメリットである．木の深さを大きくすることで制度の向上（低バイアス）が見込めるが，過学習（高バリアンス）に陥る可能性もある．\n",
    "##### ・ランダムフォレスト（RF）\n",
    "　バギングを用いて複数の決定木を学習させ，その多数決（アンサンブル学習）によって分類する手法である．単体の決定木よりも制度の向上が見込まれ，学習と評価は決定木が並列していることから高速に行われる．無相関な説明変数が多いと失敗する．\n",

    "標準化をしないと警告文が出力されることがあった．また，データセットとモデルによって標準化を行った方が精度が良くなるものと，行わない方が精度が良くなるものの両方が確認できた．興味深いことに，Irisデータではどのモデルも精度が等しくなった．これは，単純なモデルでも予測可能なほどデータがシンプルであった一方で，数個のデータに大きな矛盾があり，どのモデルにおいても上手くフィッティングができなかったものと考えられる．MNISTの結果に関しては，rbfカーネルを用い標準化を行わなかったSVMが0.98越えの高精度を記録した．これより，MNISTには非線形なデータが多く分布し，それを表現するのに最適だったものと考えられる．非線形なデータの予測に関しては，決定木でも可能であると考えられ，それを利用したRFやABも有効であると考えられるが，決定木の精度が悪く，SVMには及ばなかった．また，Fashion-MNISTの結果に関しては，標準化なしのGBDTが最良となった．GBDTに関しては，その他のデータに関しても比較的高い精度が得られ，汎用的であるといえる．"

    "### 2. GBDTの上位互換モデルであるLightGBMの検証\n",
    "　GBDTは汎用的であることが確認できたが，以下のような短所があった．\n",
    "- 計算時間の長さ：各決定木を逐次的に構築するため，木の数が増えるにつれて計算時間が比較的長かった．（特に大規模データセットで影響大）\n",
    "- メモリ消費の多さ：全てのデータをメモリに保持しながら学習を進めるため，大きなデータセットではメモリ使用量が高くなる可能性があった．\n",
    "- 過学習のリスク：特に深い木を構築する場合，トレーニングデータに対して過学習しやすい．（適切な正則化手法を講じないとモデルの汎化性能が悪化）\n",
    "- 特徴量の数が多い場合の問題：多くの特徴量が存在する場合，全ての特徴量に対してスプリットを検討するため，計算量が急増する．（高次元データに対して特徴選択や次元削減が必要）\n",
    "\n",
    "　これらの課題を，以下のようなアルゴリズムによって克服したモデルLightGDMというものを見つけた．\n",
    "- Leaf-wise（葉優先）成長戦略：最も損失を減らせる葉ノードを優先的に成長させることで，従来のDepth-wise（深さ優先）戦略に比べて少ない木の数でより高精度を実現し，全体の学習時間を短縮した．\n",
    "- ヒストグラムベースのアルゴリズム：特徴量をビン（区間）に分けてヒストグラム化することで，連続的な特徴量の処理を効率化し，計算量を大幅に削減することによってメモリ使用量を押さえた．（大規模データセットでも迅速に学習可能）\n",
    "- GOSS（Gradient-based One-Side Sampling）：勾配が大きいデータサンプルを優先的に選び，勾配が小さいデータの一部をランダムにサンプリングする手法によって，重要な情報を損なうことなくサンプル数を減らし，計算負荷を軽減した．\n",
    "- EFB（Exclusive Feature Bundling）：疎な特徴量を束ねるEFBを利用することで次元数を減少させ，データのメモリ消費を削減し学習効率が向上した．\n",
    "- 並列学習と分散学習のサポート：マルチスレッドおよび分散学習により，データを複数のスレッドやマシンに分けて処理でき，学習時間がさらに短縮された．\n",
    "- Early Stopping（早期停止）：バリデーションセットを用いて早期停止を行うことが可能であり，不要な計算を省きモデルの過学習を防ぐ．"
